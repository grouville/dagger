GraphQL has a few built-in scalar types, like Int, Float, String, Boolean, and ID. These represent the basic data types that you can use in your schema. However, sometimes you need to represent data in a way that these built-in types don't support, and that's when you might want to use a custom scalar type.

A scalar type in GraphQL represents the leaf nodes of your API requests. They are the actual data that gets sent over the wire from the server to the client. When you define a custom scalar type, you need to define three operations:

- Serialization: This is how your server takes the server-side representation of the type and turns it into a format that can be included in a GraphQL response. This typically means turning it into a primitive data type like a string or a number. The Serialize function in your ScalarConfig defines this operation.
- Value parsing: This is how your server takes an input value provided by the client and turns it into the server-side representation of your type. This is typically used when your custom scalar type is used as an argument value or a variable value. The ParseValue function in your ScalarConfig defines this operation.
- Literal parsing: This is similar to value parsing, but it's used when your custom scalar type is used as a literal value in the GraphQL query itself, rather than as a variable value. The ParseLiteral function in your ScalarConfig defines this operation.
The server-side representation of your type can be any Go type that makes sense for your application. It doesn't have to correspond directly to a primitive GraphQL type.

For your CustomScalarType, you've defined all three operations, but each operation just returns the value it was given without transforming it in any way. This means that your CustomScalarType behaves essentially the same as the built-in String type. If you wanted your CustomScalarType to behave differently, you could change these functions to perform some kind of transformation on the values.

In your schema, you've defined a field named echo that takes an argument of type CustomScalarType and returns a value of type Echo, which is an object type with a single field named result of type CustomScalarType. When a client sends a request to your echo field, your server will do the following:

Parse the message argument value using the ParseValue function of your CustomScalarType.
Call the Resolve function of your echo field with the parsed argument value.
The Resolve function will return a map with a single key-value pair. The key is "result" and the value is the message argument value.
Serialize the result field value using the Serialize function of your CustomScalarType.
Include the serialized result field value in the GraphQL response to the client.
I hope this helps clarify how custom scalar types work in GraphQL! Let me know if you have any other questions.
